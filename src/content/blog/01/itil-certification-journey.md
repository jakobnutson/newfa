Embarking on the ITIL certification journey is a decision that ultimately depends on your goals and priorities. However, I can provide some guidance on what to expect along the way.

Starting with the ITIL Foundation certification, you will gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of IT Service Management (ITSM). This includes the guiding principles and the Continual Improvement model. This certification is beneficial for anyone who provides services, communicates with the business, or is interested in pursuing a career in service management. The cost of the exam fee through PeopleCert is $500.

Moving on to the ITIL Specialist/Strategist modules, the names of each module reflect their purpose. You can find more information about the scope of materials covered in the Syllabus of each module. Additionally, each module offers opportunities to learn from external sources, making the learning experience more engaging. To get the most out of these modules, it is recommended to focus on the ones that align with your current job responsibilities. These modules require attendance in a course, which typically costs around $800, and includes a voucher and sometimes a second chance at the exam.

The most comprehensive and expensive certification journey is the ITIL Managing Professional (MP), which requires the completion of four modules. The total cost for this certification would be $3700, which includes the exam fees and course attendance for each module.

Ultimately, the journey towards ITIL certification is an investment in your professional development and can open up new opportunities in the IT Service Management field.
