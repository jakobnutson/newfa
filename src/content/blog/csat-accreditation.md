CaspianSat specializes in designing and operating satellite communication solutions. The company achieve their goals by using high-efficiency satellite, as well as long-range and high-throughput radio systems, combining them on the base of advanced network technologies.

In pursuit of providing even more secure services and gaining a competitive advantage in the market, the company made the strategic decision to pursue accreditation under ISO 27001:2013.

As a consultant, it was my pleasure to collaborate with the CaspianSat team in enhancing their security measures and transforming their underlying infrastructure. The consultancy process involved a comprehensive evaluation of existing security posture, implementing robust measures aligned with ISO 27001:2013 standards, and fostering a security-centric mindset throughout the organization.

Through this collaborative effort, CaspianSat not only strengthened its commitment to information security but also positioned itself as a trustworthy and secure partner in the competitive landscape.
